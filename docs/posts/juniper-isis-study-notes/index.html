<p>IS-IS or Intermediate System to Intermediate System is an exam objective in the <a href="https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/certification-tracks/ent-routing-switching-track?tab=jncis-enterprise">JNCIS-ENT</a> curriculum and a routing protocol I had never actually come across before. At the time when I studied the CCNA and CCNP IS-IS was mentioned but never looked at in detail, this may have changed by now.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about IS-IS is that was inteded to superceed OSPF once the OSI model became widely adopted. As IS-IS was originally developed a long time ago and the OSI model never really overtook TCP/IP there are some legacy concepts in IS-IS that newer engineers like myself wont understand/recognise. One being CLNP or Connectionless-Mode Network Protocol which when looking at the name was the OSI model replacement for UDP in TCP/IP. CLNP traffic was also intended to be sent across ISO addressing another largely forgotten concept.</p>
<p>One of the reasons IS-IS is still used today and wasn&rsquo;t largely left behind like the bulk of the OSI model is that it is comparatively easy to expand on due to TLVs which I&rsquo;ll cover.</p>
<p>As IS-IS was inteded to replace OSPF they both have lots in common with each other. Firstly IS-IS is an interor gate protcol (IGP) intended to route insde an autonoumous system. Both protocols are considered link-state based and form adjacenies to build their link state databases evne using the same shortest path first algorithm. Both protocols elected a designated router based on prorities to reduce protocol chatter. Additionally both protocols have the concept of Areas with IS-IS adding the concept of levels. While the similarities sound great from a learning perspective, there are some big differences between the two which are covereted below.</p>
<h6 id="iso-addressing">
  <strong>ISO Addressing</strong>
  <a class="heading-link" href="#iso-addressing">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h6>
<p>ISO addresses can be difficult to look at but actually aren&rsquo;t hugely complicated. Each ISO address points to a unique Network Service Access Point (NSAP). In addition to this each Network Entity has a &ldquo;Network Entity Title&rdquo;, a special address broken down blow.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="/images/posts/2019/02/ISO_Address.png"><img src="/images/posts/2019/02/ISO_Address.png" width="320" ></a></div> 
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>AFI - Autority and Format ID: In the past an authority such as ARIN/RIPE would hand out NSAP addresses however this doesn't happen anymore. The 49.* is the ISO equivalent to a private address. </li> 
  <li>Area ID: This is a similar concept to OSPF, the example area ID would be 1 here.</li>
  <li>System ID:  This is a unique identified, common practice is to use the loopback IP address (192.168.1.1). </li>
  <li>Selctor:  Also known as the NSEL, it is similar to a port/socket in IP. 00 address identifies the device itself. </li>
</ul>  
<p>It is important to note I did not include the Domain ID in my example. The domain ID is mentioned in the Juniper configuration I haven&rsquo;t come across it in my studies so I don&rsquo;t belive it will be in the JNCIS-ENT exam.</p>
<h6 id="is-is-area--levels">
  <strong>IS-IS Area &amp; Levels</strong>
  <a class="heading-link" href="#is-is-area--levels">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h6>
<p>One of the major differences between OSPF and IS-IS is Levels. IS-IS autonoumous systems can be broken down into either a Level 1 or Level 2 domain. Areas are also used in IS-IS and can increment continually as long a the areas are contigous. Level 1 domains are like totally stubby areas in OSPF. A Level 1 router can only route within the area while a Level 2 router will have an &ldquo;attached bit&rdquo; set that will cause Level 1 routers to generate a default route via the Level 2 router.</p>
<p>A router can operate a Level 1 and Level 2 router at the same time. These devices act as level boundaries routing between areas. Level 2 can be thought of like area 0 in OSPF as it is the backbone performing inter-area routing were as level 1 is doing intra-area routing.</p>
<p>Level 1 paths are preferred over Level 2 paths.</p>
<h6 id="is-is-packet-types">
  <strong>IS-IS Packet Types</strong>
  <a class="heading-link" href="#is-is-packet-types">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h6>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Link State PDUs (LSP) -
These packets are flooded perodically <em>within</em> an area to ensure link-state database information refreshes. A Link-State PDU consists of the System ID (6 Bytes), Circuit ID (1 Byte) and a Link-State PDU Number (1 Byte). These PDUs describe reachable addresses and identify Adjacencies and their states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello PDU (IIH) -
Also known as the IIH packet, these are used for neighbor discovery and to maintain adjacencies. OSPF forces the dead/hold timer to match between two neighbors but IS-IS does not, each router will adhere to its neighbors timer. There are seperate hello types for broadcast and P2P networks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The default Hello/Hold times in Juniper is 9/27 seconds for standard routers and 3/9 for the DIS router.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Complete Sequence Number PDU (CSNP) -
This PDU type contains a description or the headers of all the link-state PDUs in the database and is sent periodically on LANs. If a router recieves and comapres a CSNP to its own database and notices missing information it will request the missing LSPs using the next PDU type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partial Sequence Number PDU (PSCP) -
These types of PDU are sent for two reason; firstly to acknowledge receipt of an LSP. Secondly to request a missing LSP to fill in a gap within the senders routing tables</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h6 id="is-is-dis">
  <strong>IS-IS DIS</strong>
  <a class="heading-link" href="#is-is-dis">

</h6>
<p>TBC</p>
<p>The Designated Intermediate System or DIS is similar to DR in OSPF. Unlike a DR there is no backup of the DIS, and it is simply a psuedonode that advertises to all attached routers. In IS-IS every router forms an adjacency with every other router, not just the DIS. Every router will advertise a single link to the pseudonode, including the DIS device itself.</p>
<p>The DIS is elected based first on prority (high preferred default is 64). The prority can be set between 0 and 127 and when tied the higher MAC address wins. If a router with a higher prority comes into the network it will become the DIS.</p>

</h6>
<p>TBC</p>
<p>The default behaviour for IS-IS metrics is to have a maximum interface metric value of 63 and a maximum path metric of 1023.
Wide metrics were later added to increase the values available.</p>
<p>Rather than set every interface metric a reference metric can be used on speed. IS-IS is also capable of factoring in Delay, Cost and something else?</p>
