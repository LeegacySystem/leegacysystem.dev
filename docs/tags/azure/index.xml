      <description>I probably first used the Azure Machine Learning service mid-2022, just before OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT exploded in popularity.&#xA;This was before Azure OpenAI service and its corresponding Azure OpenAI studio was available, even back then I noticed the Machine Learning workspace studio UI was changing reguarly with new features being added. After Azure OpenAI was released, the pace of change seemed to accelerate even more.&#xA;I’ll admit, I didn’t document any of these UI changes, and I’m definitely not motivated enough to sift through release logs so I’m relying on my sub-par memory here, but I swear the ML studio UI was different!</description>
